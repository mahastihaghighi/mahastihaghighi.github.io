I first became interested in computing at the age of eighteen when I decided to enroll in a computer course at university when I decided to use all my savings to buy my own. This was a huge investment for a working class Iranian teenager like me. Once I had my own computer, I was able to learn and improve my skills by using it for my everyday needs. Teaching myself algorithms and data structure opened my mind to how computers really work. When I immigrated to the United States to start a new life, I thought of pursuing my lifelong interest and learning web designing. My sister who is a clinical informatician introduce me to Flatiron and the wonderful opportunities this institution provides for women. I think web development is a perfect skill to learn to elevate myself in life.  As a web developer, I can be my own boss, work for the company or become an entrepreneur and start a business. As someone who has worked in big enterprise companies for years, I have that entrepreneurial spirit within me. Learning web developing will not only allow me to be able to manifest all my ideas myself. Last, coding will enable me to connect with an unlimited amount of people halfway across the world in an instant. I am really looking forward to the challenges and I would welcome the opportunity to concentrate on the subject I am passionate about".

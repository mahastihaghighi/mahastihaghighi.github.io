When you pour a little bit of milk in a glass. The amount of milk can vary from a little bit to a full glass. For that reason, we call the amount of milk a variable. A variable may contain a numeric value or a name, depends on which USE you imagine. 
Methods are an object’s behavior
Objects have methods, allowing us to do interesting stuff with them. An object’s methods are things that the object can do.
Think about a person, like, a friend of yours. You can ask this person for their name (call a method), and they’ll tell you (return it to you). Their name is a piece of knowledge that this person has, and the ability to tell it to you (respond to your question) is a piece of behavior (a method) they have.
We could also ask them to make, and bring a cup of tea for us. Or we could ask them to remember a phone number, or email password.

For being a good programmer we have to  know and use variables and methods precisely.
